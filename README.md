The DR Who Game

This is a game that I started when learning conditional statements in Javascript. I wanted to reinforce what I had learned, so I came up with the idea of creating a game that would ask a series of questions about The 12 Doctors of Doctor who, to guess their favorite Dr. The Javascript may seem simple and could also been done with functions, loops or a range of other ways to complete this, but because I am new to Javascript I decided to stick to if/else statements. I also wanted to create the TARDIS using only HTML and CSS, so I could familiarise myself with CSS. 

This is a work in progess can't wast to see how it turns out.
